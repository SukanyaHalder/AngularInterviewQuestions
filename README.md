1	What is Angular Framework?
	- Angular is a typescript based development platform to build efficient and sophisticated single-page apps
	
2	What is the difference between AngularJS and Angular?
	- Angular has a CLI
	- It is written in TypeScript
	- AngularJS was MVC based where as Angular is Web-Components architecture of development based

What were the drawbacks of AngularJS?

What are the advantages of Angular over AngularJS?

What is Web-Components architecture?
 - reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code
 - the application is divided into components
 - these components contain reusable UI contents that are dynamic in nature
 - Mainly these are implemented using custom elements, Shadow Doms, ES Modules and HTML Templates
 - Features of web component
		A web component must be a custom HTML element.
		A web component should contain all the logic to function itself.
		A web component must not affect other components and other parts of the application unintentionally.
		A web component must encapsulate itself to avoid any collisions between outside JavaScript or CSS.
		Multiple instances of the same web component must not interfere with each other.

Shadow-DOM?
- Shadow DOM allows hidden DOM trees to be attached to elements in the regular DOM tree — this shadow DOM tree starts with a shadow root, underneath which can be attached to any elements you want, in the same way as the normal DOM.
	Shadow host: The regular DOM node that the shadow DOM is attached to.
	Shadow tree: The DOM tree inside the shadow DOM.
	Shadow boundary: the place where the shadow DOM ends, and the regular DOM begins.
	Shadow root: The root node of the shadow tree.
	
Advantages of Angular 2+?
- CROSS PLATFORM - Progressive Web Apps, Native, Desktop
- Robust - 
- PRODUCTIVITY
	
Ng-Modules
	- NgModules configures injector and compiler
	- It is a collection of related code -  components, directives, and pipes into cohesive blocks of functionality
	- Each such collection/module works on a focussed area
	- It identifies the public components, directives, and pipes so that they could be accessed from outside
	- It registers service providers to be injected to components
	- Angular libraries are NgModules
	- Some in-built angular modules are FormsModule, HttpClientModule, and RouterModule
	- Some third party angular modules are  Material Design, Ionic
